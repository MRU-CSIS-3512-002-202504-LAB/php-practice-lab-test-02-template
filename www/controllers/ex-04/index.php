First, this controller should:
  - Get a value (blue, red, or delete are the only valid ones) from 
    any query string present with the key 'colour'.
    - If the value is 'blue', a 5-day persistent cookie with the key 
      'colour' and value 'blue' should be created.
    - If the value is 'red', a 5-day persistent cookie with the key 
      'colour' and value 'red' should be created.
    - If the value is delete, the cookie with the key 'colour' should
      be deleted.

TODO: EX-04

At this point, the controller should:
  - See if there is a cookie present in the browser request with the key 'colour' and if so:
    - If the value is "blue", set a variable with the blue cookie image
      path.
    - If the value is "red", set a variable with the red cookie image
      path.
  - Bring in the appropriate view.
