    <!--

    TODO: EX-03

    Make changes to this view (here between the div#container tags) so there
    is a form that POSTs upon submission.

    The form should have two input tags, one to hold the country iso
    and the other to submit the form.

    You MAY wish to put this form in a partial, since the exact same
    form code is used again in search.view.php...but it is not necessary 
    if you're pressed for time.

    -->


    <!--

    TODO: EX-03

    Make changes to this view (here after the form, but before the div.container closing tag) to:
      - Display the proper message in an <h1> if no records are 
        being passed in by the controller.
      - Display the proper message in an <h1> if there are records
        being passed in by the controller, and then an ordered list
        of cities and populations in the desired format.

    -->
