    <!--

    TODO: EX-03

    Make changes to this view (here between the div#container tags) so there
    is a form that POSTs upon submission.

    The form should have two input tags, one to hold the country iso
    and the other to submit the form.

    You MAY wish to put this form in a partial, since the exact same
    form code is used again in results.view.php...but it is not necessary 
    if you're pressed for time.

    -->
